# Ising Model

Cipra, 1987:

> The Ising model is named after Ernst Ising, who did the first work on it in the early 1920s. The Ising model is concerned with the physics of phase transitions, which occur when a small change in a parameter such as temperature or pressure causes a large-scale, qualitative change in the state of a system.

There are two approaches available in this repository:
- [Diagonalization method](./docs/diagonalization.md),
- and the [Monte Carlo method](./docs/montecarlo.md).
